# Refractoring Code
## Challenge 2

### Overview of Project: 
We took a look at a set of data from the stock market so that we could help advise Steve and his parent about the best investment option given the previous data

### Results: 
As for the data we can see that only 2 tickers had a positive margin after year 2018, but only ENPH raised that margin from 82% one year to 129% the next year, as oposed to RUN who Managed to keep a positive margin but that argin dropped from 84% to only 5% the next year.

For the refractored data, we may be able to get even better procesing by doing even better refractoring than the advice given by the assignment, in my case, for my computer the new code did worse than the original by almost 5x. i tried trouble shooting the problem but it didnt seem to fix anything any way.

### Summary: 
#### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
The main advatage is that your code runs smoother and faster, which almost everytime translates to money. 
But on the other hand maybe the time saved is so insignificant that the time spent could have been used for something more productive.
There is also the posibility (as it happened to me) that the new refractored code runs worse than the first one so you end up loosing even more time.

#### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
The code is easier to understand for sure, but at least or me the new refaractored code ran slower than the original.
